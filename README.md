# Evil Insult Generator Prototype



## Idea
After completing a Clima module of the [Flutter Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/) I was thinking of building my own Flutter App with data from the interner. The first API I stumbled on was the Evil Insult Generator API and I decided not to waste time on searching and just try this one out. I made this app only for educational purposes, to repeat and practice the concepts I learned in the Flutter Development Bootcamp such as Futures, Async/Await, Final/Const, Json Parsing and so on.

##Design & Functionality 
The App has a very simple design and a couple of features, such as:
- Generating new insults in different languages
- Saving insults (but only for the time the app is running)
- Sharing insults in social media
